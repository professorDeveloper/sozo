/**
 * Where the extension runtimes look names up.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it is not
 *
 * It is not a VPN and it is not a proxy. The bytes still travel the same route
 * to the same servers, from the same address; the only thing that changes is
 * who answers the question "what is the address of this host". That is enough
 * for the common case — an ISP that blocks a site by refusing to resolve it —
 * and nothing at all for a block by address or by SNI.
 *
 * Saying so matters: somebody who picks Cloudflare here expecting the privacy
 * of a VPN has been misled by the app, and the setting's own description is the
 * only place that can tell them.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here rather than in one client
 *
 * Three runtimes make their own requests — Aniyomi and Manga share
 * [eu.kanade.tachiyomi.network.NetworkHelper], CloudStream has its own inside
 * the library — and the resolver has to be the same object for all of them or
 * the setting would apply to some sources and not others, with nothing on
 * screen to say which.
 *
 * The bootstrap client is deliberately plain: a DoH resolver has to reach its
 * own endpoint, and routing that lookup through itself is a loop.
